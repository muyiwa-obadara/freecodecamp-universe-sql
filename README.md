# FreeCodeCamp Universe SQL Project

Welcome to the FreeCodeCamp Universe SQL project! This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Relational Database curriculum, where you'll create and manage a database of celestial bodies.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll use PostgreSQL to build a database that stores information about various celestial bodies such as planets, moons, stars, and more. The goal is to practice SQL queries, database design, and data manipulation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of SQL

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/muyiwa-obadara/freecodecamp-universe-sql.git
   cd freecodecamp-universe-sql
   ```

2. **Import the database:**
   ```bash
   psql -U <yourusername> -f universe.sql
   ```

## Project Structure

- `universe.sql`: The main SQL file containing the database schema and initial data.

## Usage

Once the database is set up, you can start running SQL queries to interact with the data. Here are some example queries:

- **List all planets:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM planets;
  ```

- **Find moons of a specific planet:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM moons WHERE planet_id = 1;
  ```
